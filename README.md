SourceLog
=========

SourceLog is a source control repository monitor application that tracks changes committed to a repository and displays details of each change including a side by side diff of each file changed.  The application allows the user to track changes to any number of repositories through "subscriptions" to repository paths. A number of version control systems are supported through a plugin model. Users are notified as changes are committed to the repository and new changes are marked as unread and displayed in bold.
